                            of a church during infancy who have mutual aspirations and rivalry of becoming 
                            the next Wizard King.

                            thoughts and goals, much to the annoyance of some of those around him, and often 
                            in spite of other people's opinions.
                            Although Asta possesses no magical power, he overcame his weakness by increasing his 
                            physical strength, which allowed him to join the Magic Knight Squad known as 
                            the Black Bulls after acquiring a five-leaf clover grimoire.
