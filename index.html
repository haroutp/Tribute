                            important to not give up to despair and to surpass your limits.

                            of a church during infancy who have mutual aspirations and rivalry of becoming 
                            the next Wizard King.

                            Asta generally is cheerful and hyperactive. He tends to shout to express his 
                            thoughts and goals, much to the annoyance of some of those around him, and often 
                            in spite of other people's opinions.
                            Although Asta possesses no magical power, he overcame his weakness by increasing his 
                            physical strength, which allowed him to join the Magic Knight Squad known as 
                            the Black Bulls after acquiring a five-leaf clover grimoire.
